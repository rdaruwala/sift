SIFT
====

Satellite Information Familiarization Tool (SIFT) was designed by the SSEC to
support scientists during forecaster training events. It provides a graphical
interface for visualization and basic analysis of geostationary satellite data.

The Project Wiki and Git repository can be accessed at
https://gitlab.ssec.wisc.edu/SIFT/sift/wikis/home.

SIFT is built on open source technologies like Python, OpenGL, and PyQt4. It
can be run from Mac, Windows, and Linux.

Data Access
-----------

SIFT currently accepts a limited number of input formats. It is able to load
NetCDF4 L1B files for the GOES-16 ABI instrument. It will accept more input
files in the future. Please contact Jordan Gerth, Ray Garcia, or David Hoese
to get access to this early release data set.

Installation
------------

SIFT installers and bundles are available on the SIFT FTP location:

ftp://ftp.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/sift/dist
    
The Windows installers end in `.exe`, Linux with `.tar.gz`, and Mac OSX with
`.dmg`. See the sections below for details on installing SIFT for each
operating system.

### Run on Windows

After executing the downloaded `.exe` installer follow the installation
wizard to install SIFT. SIFT can then be run from the "SIFT" shortcut
in the start menu. By default SIFT caches files in a "Workspace" located
at the user's `Documents/sift_workspace`. The installation wizard allows
you to customize this location.

### Run on Linux

The downloaded tarball `.tar.gz` can be extracted by running:

    tar -xf SIFT_X.Y.Z.tar.gz
    
SIFT can then be run by executing the `SIFT/SIFT`. Run `SIFT/SIFT -h`
for available command line options.

If SIFT will not start please ensure that the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment
variable is not set.

### Run on Mac

The downloaded DMG file can be extracted opened by double clicking on it.
The available `.app` should then be moved to the appropriate `Applications`
folder. Double clicking the `.app` icon from `Applications` will execute
SIFT.

### Installing with Conda

SIFT can also be installed with the Anaconda/Conda package manager. Python
3.6 is currently the only supported python environment. It can be installed by
running:

    conda install -c http://larch.ssec.wisc.edu/channels/sift sift
    
And then run with:

    python -m sift
    
The `-h` flag can be added for documentation on additional command line
options.
